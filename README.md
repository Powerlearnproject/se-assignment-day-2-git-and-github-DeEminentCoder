## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version Control System is a method that helps people keep track of changes made to files over time.
GitHub is a popular tool because projects stored on GitHub are accessible anywhere in the world which makes it easy for team collaborations.
Version Control System helps maintain project integrity by saving versions regularly, ensuring no work is lost if a mistake is made or something goes wrong.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
1. Sign In to GitHub and
2. Create a repository
KEY STEPS AND DECISION... INCLUDE:
-Choosing a repo name and description
-choosing visibility (Private & Private)
-Adding .gitignore file


## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
A README file is like a welcome guide for a project that tells people what the project is about, how to use it and why it's important.
WHAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED INCLUDE:
1. Project Tittle
2. Installation instructions
3. Usage guide
4. Features
5. Licence
6. Contact Information.

It helps people quickly understand how to get involved and what is expected.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
Public repo is open and visible to eveyone while Private repo gives privacy
Public repo attractions audience while private repo is limited to only the invited users.
Public repo is open to more opportunities for feedback and learning  while private repo has feedback that is limited to fewer group.

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
A commit is a snapshot of of all your files at a specific point in time and record changes a person made.
Commits help:
in tracking changes
in undoing mistakes
in providing a history of a project.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branching allows a person to create a separate version of a project within the same repo.
TYPICAL WORKFLOW FOR BRANCHING:
1. create a new branch (cd (repo-name)
2. make changes and commit (git add .)
3. merge branch (git checkout main) (git merge feature-branch)
4. push changes to github (git push origin main)

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
A pull request is a feature that lets a person propose changes to a project and request that those changes be reviewed and merged into the main codebase.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
Forking a repo on GitHub creates a personal copy of someone else's project in your own Github account.
Forking make a copy of the original project into a person's Github account while cloning downloads a copy of a repo to the local computer.
SCENARIO...:
1. Contributing to Open source projects
2. Customising a project
3. 

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
